<u> amendments to the Public Order Act "provide the police with the powers to impose conditions on harmful protests" and "provide further clarity", Suella Braverman has said.<</u>

"This has required over 13,770 police officer shifts, that's over 13,000 police shifts that could have been stopping robbery, violent crime or anti-social behaviour, and the cost to the taxpayer is an outrage - £4.5 million in just six weeks on top of the £14 million spent last year.</i><br>
